# What's Next?

Quite a lot! Here are some research directions I am looking forward to pursuing
next:

- Applying forward simulation techniques I've developed to novel scientific
  contexts

- Efficient forward simulations for solving inverse problems

- Incorporating data science of observations to better guide numerical
  simulations to the right initial hypotheses

- Combining Machine Learning surrogate modeling with multiscale simulation
  frameworks with reliable error control

- Adaptive subgrid methods that more efficiently use computational resources by
  adapting our accuracy to each term in the PDE system we model
