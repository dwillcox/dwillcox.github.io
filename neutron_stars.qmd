Solving nuclear reactions on GPUs enabled accelerated nuclear astrophysics simulations using the Castro compressible hydrodynamics code.
For more details about how we accelerated our nuclear reaction solver, see [Nuclear Reactions](nuclear_reactions.qmd).

My GPU work enabled our nuclear astrophysics collaboration to simulate detailed
two and three-dimensional nuclear flames on neutron star surfaces!

Neutron stars in binary star systems can under certain astrophysical conditions
accrete material from their companion star. In these cases, the neutron star's
atmosphere can undergo periodic thermonuclear runaway burning visible from
Earth as a bright burst of X-rays.

By carefully modeling the X-ray burst physics, we hope to correlate observed
X-ray bursts with properties of the unseen, super-dense neutron star core
hiding below its atmosphere.

At LBL, I also collaborated with scientists who worked on electromagnetic
modeling for particle accelerator physics. Together, we started a project to
model relativistic particle acceleration from magnetic reconnection in rapidly
rotating neutron star magnetospheres.

We worked with a talented intern, Eloise Yang, who set up these simulations in
the WarpX electromagnetic particle-in-cell (PIC) code. After Eloise left LBL,
postdoc Hannah Klion picked up the project. Our project's first paper explored
new advances in electromagnetic PIC solver methods and their utility for
simulating charge acceleration from relativistic magnetic reconnection.

For details, see @klion_pic_2023.

This research sets the foundation for applying our numerical
methods to simulate high-energy particle emission from not only magnetic
reconnection but also cosmic ray acceleration in other astrophysical
environments.
