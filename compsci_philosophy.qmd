# Computational Science Philosophy

I am equally a computational scientist as I am a physicist. In fact, I consider
all these tightly interrelated. I analyze research topics from a physics
perspective. Then I use the tools of computation and applied mathematics to
carry out science by testing and falsifying hypotheses.

## My Approach To Computational Science

My approach is to achieve reproducible results by thorough code documentation,
strict version control, and ongoing testing.

Validation is ongoing, not just at the end of a project or done once and then
forgotten.

Development should keep in mind specific tests the numerical code should pass.
Sometimes this means unit tests, sometimes this means regression tests.

Run tests on an ongoing basis using Continuous Integration through, e.g. GitHub
Actions or an equivalent.

Catch regression or unit test errors at pull request review time, if not
earlier, before breaking changes have a chance to make it into the main code.
This simple approach is enormously useful when a bug appears in my simulations
and I find myself backtracking through the code history to pinpoint where it
came from!

Always have someone review your code, even if you are just working with one
other person.
