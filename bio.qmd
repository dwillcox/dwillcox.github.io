Hi! I'm Don Willcox, a computational physicist.

Thanks for stopping by, if you would like to get in touch, contact me at
[eugene.willcox@gmail.com](mailto:eugene.willcox@gmail.com).

## About Me

Most recently, I worked as a project scientist in the Center for Computational
Sciences and Engineering (CCSE).

[CCSE](https://ccse.lbl.gov) is a computational science research group within
the Applied Mathematics and Computational Research Division at Berkeley Lab.

My research in computational astrophysics includes algorithms for nuclear
burning, solving PDEs on adaptive meshes, and neutrino quantum kinetics. I also
develop methods for accelerating these algorithms for GPU-based supercomputers.
Most recently, I've also worked on mesoscale atmospheric modeling as part of
the Energy Research and Forecasting (ERF) project.

Nowadays, I'm interested in adaptively accurate methods for multiphysics
modules in the large-scale codes I have developed.

I'm also interested in using forward simulations and data science together with
machine learning to more efficiently answer inverse scientific questions.

Before joining Berkeley Lab, I completed my PhD in Physics at Stony Brook
University in August 2018.

My PhD thesis used the FLASH code to simulate thermonuclear supernovae from
novel hybrid white dwarf stars. I also designed reacting-hydrodynamics
simulations with the MAESTRO code to quantify nuclear energy transport by the
convective Urca process in carbon-oxygen white dwarf supernovae progenitors. 

For information about my research, see my [Research pages](research.qmd).

I enjoy collaborating with other scientists as well as helping train graduate
and undergraduate researchers in computational science methods.

For a list of student interns I've advised at LBNL,
see the [Research Advising](cv.qmd#research-advising) section of my CV.

Opportunities for [scientific outreach](cv.qmd#community-outreach) are also
meaningful to me because many professors and research advisors have invested
their time and energy to make me the scientist I am today. Recognizing I stand
on their shoulders inspires me to give back to the scientific community and
public.

When I'm not doing science, I enjoy reading science fiction and trying to cook
new recipes. Sometimes I even take walks outside when I'm especially ambitious!
