Hi! I'm Don Willcox, a project scientist in the Center for Computational
Sciences and Engineering (CCSE) in the Computational Research Division at
Berkeley Lab.

My research in computational astrophysics includes algorithms for nuclear
burning, solving PDEs on adaptive meshes, and neutrino quantum kinetics. I also
develop methods for accelerating these algorithms for GPU-based supercomputers.
Most recently, I've also joined the ERF project developing code for mesoscale
atmospheric modelling.

Before joining Berkeley Lab, I completed my PhD in
Physics at Stony Brook University in August 2018 working on thermonuclear
supernovae modeling and the convective Urca process in white dwarf stars.
