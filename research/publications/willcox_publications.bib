abstract = {High performance computing (HPC) architectures have undergone rapid development in recent years. As a result, established software suites face an ever increasing challenge to remain performant on and portable across modern systems. Many of the widely adopted atmospheric modeling codes cannot fully (or in some cases, at all) leverage the acceleration provided by General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units, leaving users of those codes constrained to increasingly limited HPC resources. Energy Research and Forecasting (ERF) is a regional atmospheric modeling code that leverages the latest HPC architectures, whether composed of only Central Processing Units (CPUs) or incorporating GPUs. ERF contains many of the standard discretizations and basic features needed to model general atmospheric dynamics. The modular design of ERF provides a flexible platform for exploring different physics parameterizations and numerical strategies. ERF is built on a state-of-the-art, well-supported, software framework (AMReX) that provides a performance portable interface and ensures ERF's long-term sustainability on next generation computing systems. This paper details the numerical methodology of ERF, presents results for a series of verification/validation cases, and documents ERF's performance on current HPC systems. The roughly 5× speed up of ERF (using GPUs) over Weather Research and Forecasting (CPUs only) for a 3D squall line test case highlights the significance of leveraging GPU acceleration.},

              The dimmest and most numerous outlier of the Type Ia supernova population, the Type Iax event, is increasingly being found in the results of observational campaigns. There is currently no single accepted model to describe these events. This 2D study explores the viability of modeling Type Iax events as a hybrid C/O/Ne white dwarf progenitor undergoing a deflagration using the multiphysics software {FLASH}. This hybrid was created using the stellar evolution code {MESA}, and its C-depleted core and mixed structure have demonstrated lower yields than traditional C/O progenitors in previous deflagration-to-detonation studies. To generate a sample, 30 “realizations” of this simulation were performed, the only difference being the shape of the initial match head used to start the deflagration. Consistent with earlier work, these realizations produce the familiar hot dense bound remnant surrounded by sparse ejecta. Our results indicate that the majority of the star remains unburned (∼70\%) and bound ({\textgreater}90\%). Our realizations produce total ejecta yields on the order of 10

	abstract = {Abstract
            Relativistic magnetic reconnection is a nonideal plasma process that is a source of nonthermal particle acceleration in many high-energy astrophysical systems. Particle-in-cell ({PIC}) methods are commonly used for simulating reconnection from first principles. While much progress has been made in understanding the physics of reconnection, especially in 2D, the adoption of advanced algorithms and numerical techniques for efficiently modeling such systems has been limited. With the {GPU}-accelerated {PIC} code {WarpX}, we explore the accuracy and potential performance benefits of two advanced Maxwell solver algorithms: a nonstandard finite-difference scheme ({CKC}) and an ultrahigh-order pseudo-spectral method ({PSATD}). We find that, for the relativistic reconnection problem, {CKC} and {PSATD} qualitatively and quantitatively match the standard Yee-grid finite-difference method. {CKC} and {PSATD} both admit a time step that is 40\% longer than that of Yee, resulting in a ∼40\% faster time to solution for {CKC}, but no performance benefit for {PSATD} when using a current deposition scheme that satisfies Gauss’s law. Relaxing this constraint maintains accuracy and yields a 30\% speedup. Unlike Yee and {CKC}, {PSATD} is numerically stable at any time step, allowing for a larger time step than with the finite-difference methods. We found that increasing the time step 2.4–3 times over the standard Yee step still yields accurate results, but it only translates to modest performance improvements over {CKC}, due to the current deposition scheme used with {PSATD}. Further optimization of this scheme will likely improve the effective performance of {PSATD}.},

Our customized approach includes options for the form of the loss functions, a demonstration that the use of parallel neural networks leads to increased accuracy, and a description of a perturbational approach in the training step that robustifies the model. We test our approach on millimeter-scale flames using a single-step, 3-isotope network describing the first stages of carbon fusion occurring in Type Ia supernovae. We train the neural networks using simulation data from a standard {MAESTROeX} simulation, and show that the resulting model can be effectively applied to different flame configurations.

            Axions are hypothetical particles that may explain the observed dark matter density and the non-observation of a neutron electric dipole moment. An increasing number of axion laboratory searches are underway worldwide, but these efforts are made difficult by the fact that the axion mass is largely unconstrained. If the axion is generated after inflation there is a unique mass that gives rise to the observed dark matter abundance; due to nonlinearities and topological defects known as strings, computing this mass accurately has been a challenge for four decades. Recent works, making use of large static lattice simulations, have led to largely disparate predictions for the axion mass, spanning the range from 25 microelectronvolts to over 500 microelectronvolts. In this work we show that adaptive mesh refinement simulations are better suited for axion cosmology than the previously-used static lattice simulations because only the string cores require high spatial resolution. Using dedicated adaptive mesh refinement simulations we obtain an over three order of magnitude leap in dynamic range and provide evidence that axion strings radiate their energy with a scale-invariant spectrum, to within {\textasciitilde}5\% precision, leading to a mass prediction in the range (40,180) microelectronvolts.},

            Many astrophysical environments involve convective or explosive flows driven by thermonuclear reactions (Type Ia supernovae, classical novae, X-ray bursts, stellar evolution). Simulation codes need to accurately capture the interactions between reactions and hydrodynamics to produce realistic models of these events. For astrophysical reacting flows, operator splitting is commonly used to couple hydrodynamics and reactions. Each process operates independent of one another, but by staggering the updates in a symmetric fashion (via Strang splitting) second order accuracy in time can be achieved. However, approximations are often made to the reacting system, including the choice of whether or not to integrate temperature with the species. Here we demonstrate through a simple convergence test that integrating an energy equation together with reactions achieves the best convergence when modeling reactive flows with Strang splitting. Additionally, second order convergence cannot be achieved without integrating an energy or temperature equation.},

            We continue to investigate two-dimensional laterally propagating flames in type I X-ray bursts using fully compressible hydrodynamics simulations. In the current study we relax previous approximations where we artificially boosted the flames. We now use more physically realistic reaction rates, thermal conductivities, and rotation rates, exploring the effects of neutron star rotation rate and thermal structure on the flame. We find that at lower rotation rates the flame becomes harder to ignite, whereas at higher rotation rates the nuclear burning is enhanced by increased confinement from the Coriolis force and the flame propagates steadily. At higher crustal temperatures, the flame moves more quickly and accelerates as it propagates through the atmosphere. If the temperature is too high, instead of a flame propagating across the surface the entire atmosphere burns uniformly. Our findings could have implications for the relationship between observed burst rise times and neutron star rotation and accretion rates.

            Modelling long-time convective flows in the interiors of stars is extremely challenging using conventional compressible hydrodynamics codes due to the acoustic timestep limitation. Many of these flows are in the low Mach number regime, which allows us to exploit the relationship between acoustic and advective time scales to develop a more computationally efficient approach. {MAESTROeX} is an open source low Mach number stellar hydrodynamics code that allows much larger timesteps to be taken, therefore enabling systems to be modelled for much longer periods of time. This is particularly important for the problem of convection in the cores of rotating massive stars prior to core collapse. To fully capture the dynamics, it is necessary to model these systems in three dimensions at high resolution over many rotational periods. We present an overview of {MAESTROeX}’s current capabilities, describe ongoing work to incorporate the effects of rotation and discuss how we are optimising the code to run on {GPUs}.},

              The creation of “hybrid” white dwarfs, made of a C–O core within an O–Ne shell has been proposed, and studies indicate that ignition in the C-rich central region makes these viable progenitors for thermonuclear (type Ia) supernovae. Recent work found that the C–O core is mixed with the surrounding O–Ne as the white dwarf cools prior to accretion, which results in lower central C fractions in the massive progenitor than previously assumed. To further investigate the efficacy of hybrid white dwarfs as progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae, we performed simulations of thermonuclear supernovae from a new series of hybrid progenitors that include the effects of mixing during cooling. The progenitor white dwarf model was constructed with the one-dimensional stellar evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics ({MESA}) and represented a star evolved through the phase of unstable interior mixing followed by accretion until it reached conditions for the ignition of carbon burning. This {MESA} model was then mapped to a two-dimensional initial condition for explosions simulated with
              {FLASH}
              . For comparison, similar simulations were performed for a traditional C–O progenitor white dwarf. By comparing the yields of the explosions, we find that, as with earlier studies, the lower C abundance in the hybrid progenitor compared to the traditional C–O progenitor leads to a lower average yield of
              
                
                  
                
                
              
              . Although the unmixed hybrid white dwarf showed a similar decrement also in total iron-group yield, the mixed case does not and produces a smaller fraction of iron-group elements in the form of
              
                
                  
                
                
              
              . We attribute this to the higher central density required for ignition and the location, center or off-center, of deflagration ignition.},

              Motivated by recent results in stellar evolution that predict the existence of hybrid white dwarf ({WD}) stars with a C–O core inside an O–Ne shell, we simulate thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae from these hybrid progenitors. We use the
              {FLASH}
              code to perform multidimensional simulations in the deflagration-to-detonation transition ({DDT}) explosion paradigm. Our hybrid progenitor models were produced with the
              {MESA}
              stellar evolution code and include the effects of the Urca process, and we map the progenitor model to the
              {FLASH}
              grid. We performed a suite of {DDT} simulations over a range of ignition conditions consistent with the progenitor’s thermal and convective structure assuming multiple ignition points. To compare the results from these hybrid {WD} stars to previous results from C–O {WDs}, we construct a set of C–O {WD} models with similar properties and similarly simulate a suite of explosions. We find that despite significant variability within each suite, trends distinguishing the explosions are apparent in their
